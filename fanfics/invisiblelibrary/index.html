                <p class="ficdetails">This is set after the events of The Invisible Library, before Irene is assigned as a librarian in residence in Vale's London and after she has defeated Alberich and found out that Kai is a dragon. In the Magnus Archives continuity, it is set at some point in Season 4, given as a statement to Jonathan Sims.</p>
                <h4 class="ficdetails">Oh, there is so much more to this world than you know, Archivist. </h4>

                <p>
                    Irene sat down in the new world, tired out of her mind from the hike across the Library it had taken to get to where she was. She was situated in a dusty office of the British Library, London, where the previous Librarian in Residence had set up shop. Old books were stacked in piles on the desk, almost covering every available space.

                    Kai inhaled the dust of the room and coughed lightly, maintaining his composure in front of Irene. He glanced around, half expecting to find someone poised to jump out and attack them as they walked deeper into the dingy office. Emerging in these derelict places on a mission always put him on edge, and his inexperience as a trainee Librarian didn't do much to put him at ease on the matter.

                    “Kai. The briefing says we're looking for an Elora Harvey, senior Librarian. She should be able to provide us with fake IDs, and some local currency, enough to get settled in at least” Irene explained to her protégé, eager to get started on the mission. It was a simple book retrieval, in a world with little to no conflict between Dragons and Fae. To her knowledge, that was. There had been a few reports of Fae activity here, but no dragons had been reported in hundreds of years, so the Library assumed it to be a fairly quiet neutral ground. Unusual, for such a central and busy world in terms of stories and literature.

                <p>
                    There was an empty table in the office corner, one with webs coating the corners but empty all the same, and Irene dropped her mission briefs down in order to read further. She needed specifics. The author of the book, where it could be found, what tools she would have to be prepared to use if any, and most importantly if there was anyone else looking for the book.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-left: 2em;"><em>The book you are tasked with searching for is titled 'Ex Altiora', its author is as of yet unknown. The volume from this world has had a high volume of specific requests, so retrieving the book promptly and in pristine condition is of high importance.
                    It was last known to be in the care of an individual known as Gerard Keay, a resident of East London at the time of the report.

                    Irene was used to London. She'd been to so many different variations, seen the same street layouts so many different times in different worlds that she'd recognise a street from the grainiest of photos. A name was harder to go from, but they were in one of the largest libraries in the country, there was sure to be somewhere to start at least.
