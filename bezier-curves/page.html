    <h2>About bezier curves</h2>
    <h3>Applications in computing</h3>
    <p>When drawing curves in programs like photoshop,
      illustrate or other graphic design programs there
      is generally a 'pen tool' allowing you to draw
      fluid lines on your canvas that are easily adjustable.</p>

    <h3>How they are generated</h3>
    <p>The computer defines 4 points, illustrated by the
      four squares on the canvas above. It then picks lines between the given
      points at a certain factor, then traces the path of the new
      midpoint as the factor increases.<br/>

      A good representation of the math behind this can be found here on the MIT website.</a></p>
